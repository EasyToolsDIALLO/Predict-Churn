## To Test
### To begin: 
          Download the project
          
### 1st step: 
          Be sure to use a python version between 3.6-3.8 on your local machine because Pycaret is
          only supported by this version. But you can use the version 3.9 if you are on Ubuntu
          
### 2nd step: 
          Install the following packages
              pip install pycaret
              pip install fastapi
              pip install uvicorn
    
### 3rd step: R
          Run the code. The model is already in data folder
          
### 4th:
